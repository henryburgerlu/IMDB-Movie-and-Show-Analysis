# Recommendation:

## For Shows:

Crime, history, thriller, while less frequent, have breakout potential. Limited series reduce risk but offer prestige returns.

A limited series format (6–10 episodes) allows for great length of storytelling, lower production risk and cost, and strong international licensing appeal.

Pairing Crime with elements of Mystery, Thriller, or Documentary-style realism taps into the success of some recent hybrid genre hits (e.g., Mindhunter, Narcos, Chernobyl).

## For Movies:

Theatrical audiences are shrinking and selective. Lean into sci-fi, history, drama — genres that create conversation and a reason to go out.

Best when centered on true stories or larger-than-life figure. Should aim for cultural relevance: either through awards, innovation, or social conversation.
